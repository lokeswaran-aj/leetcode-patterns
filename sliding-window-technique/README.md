# Sliding Window Technique

The sliding window technique stands out as a versatile and efficient approach, particularly when dealing with array and list-based problems.

The sliding window technique involves maintaining a window of elements as you traverse an array or list. This window can be of **fixed** or **variable** **size**, depending on the problem at hand. The beauty of this approach lies in its ability to optimize solutions for scenarios where continuous _subarrays or subsequences_ need to be processed efficiently.

## How to identify sliding window problems

Look for problems where maintaining a continuous **subarray or subsequence** is essential and where the problem can be broken down into subproblems by efficiently traversing the array.

## Real-world Applications

* Rate Limiting
* Time Series Data Processing
* Distributed Systems and Load Balancing
* User Engagement Tracking

## Leetcode Examples

* [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)
* [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
* [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)

## Types of Sliding Window Techniques

1. Fixed-size window
2. Variable-size window

## Python Template for the sliding window algorithm

```python
def sliding_window_algorithm(nums):
    start, end = 0, 0
    result = initialize_result()  # Initialize result based on the problem

    while end < len(nums):
        # Expand the window
        current_element = nums[end]

        # Update result or perform necessary operations
        result = update_result(result, current_element)

        # Check if the current window satisfies the condition
        while condition_not_met():
            # Shrink the window from the left
            current_left_element = nums[start]
            result = update_result_on_shrink(result, current_left_element)
            start += 1

        # Move the window forward
        end += 1

    return result

```

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity**

* Time complexity: O(N), where N is the size of the input array or list.
* Each element is processed at most twice (once when it enters the window and once when it leaves the window).

**Space Complexity**

* Space complexity: O(1), as the algorithm typically uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.
* The space required for variables like `start` and `end` remains constant.
