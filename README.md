# Introduction

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) is one of the most popular platforms for practicing coding problems, especially for preparing for tech interviews. However, solving problems on Leetcode can seem daunting at first. This is where understanding Leetcode patterns comes into play.

Leetcode patterns refer to certain types of problems that frequently appear on the platform. By identifying these patterns, you can strategize your practice and become more efficient at solving problems.

## Leetcode Patterns

1. [Sliding Window](sliding-window-technique/)
2. Two Pointers
3. Stack
4. Binary Search
5. Linked List
6. Trees
7. Tries
8. Heap / Priority Queue
9. Backtracking
10. Graphs
11. Advanced Graphs
12. 1-D Dynamic Programming
13. 2-D Dynamic Programming
14. Greedy
15. Intervals
16. Math and Geometry
17. Bit Manipulation

I explain the above patterns and solve many problems under each pattern on [Neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/practice).
